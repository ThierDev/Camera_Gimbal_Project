# Camera_Gimbal_Project
This is a second year project at ISEP (Engineering School in Paris) Grade 100%
The Big challenge here was to implement the Kalman Filter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) and to make it run on a 8bit Arduino UNO 
The mecanical structure was another challenge because it had to be perfectly balanced. g\vec needed to be aligned to avoid any momentum or stress on the motors.

# Disclaimer
The code is very messy in here, big apologies, 100% garanteed I would not put this in production like this, the code is not factorized nor cleaned. The focus during this project where on electronics and especially on key concepts : PID feedback loops, Euler Angles equations, etc...
